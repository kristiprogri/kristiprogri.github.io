I am currently a Representative and a Tech Speaker with Mozilla and also worked with their Diversity and Inclusion team as part of a program that aims to offer opportunities to underrepresented groups in Open Source and Free Software communities. I have co-founded the Open Source Diversity initiative and I have organized many free software events and conferences in Albania with the focus on open technologies.
